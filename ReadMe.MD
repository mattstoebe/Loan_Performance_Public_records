Attached is an archive with some data on Public Records, and some Loan Performance data. There is also a dictionary (the spreadsheet has multiple tabs) included.  Let me know if you have any trouble downloading the archive.

Address the following pouints but also explore the data independantly

In the Public Records data:
1. Are there any anomalies in the data? What are they and how did you find them?
2. Pick a variable to investigate and evaluate the distribution - is there anything interesting?


In the Loan Performance data:
3. Are there any relationships between the performance metrics?


Once you have completed these questions, please explore the data in the way that you would typically approach it. There are a couple things to think about while you're doing this - there is performance data, but we don't just want to know what the link is with performance. Please take some time with the Public Records data on its own and explore that before looking at it in conjunction with the performance data. Python, in jupyter or another notebook type is recommended. There does not need to be an official write up, but we would like to see comments and annotations as you work through it so we can understand what you're looking at and why.
